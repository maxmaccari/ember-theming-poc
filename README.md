# theme-poc

This poc demonstrate a theming using CSS Vars with pollyfills that enable this to run on IE11.

The first example is the `vanilla`, that is the theming using the pure css and css vars. This work well on IE11.

The second example is the `bootstrap`, that shows an hack to allow customize bootstrap using CSS vars, but this doesn't 
work well on IE11 as the browser doesn't allow to use calc on colors, and there's some bugs.
